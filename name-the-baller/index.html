    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Name The Baller</strong><br>
    Last updated: <time datetime="2025-08-30">August 30, 2025</time></p>

    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This Privacy Policy describes how <em>Name The Baller</em> (the “App”) handles information across all platforms and distribution channels.</p>

    <h2>Core Statement</h2>
    <p><strong>We do not collect, store, use, or share any personal information via the App.</strong> The App does not create user accounts, does not use analytics, and does not include advertising, tracking technologies, or in-app purchases.</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal identifiers (e.g., name, email address, phone number, postal address).</li>
      <li>Device or advertising identifiers (e.g., IDFA/AAID), cookies, or similar tracking technologies.</li>
      <li>Precise or coarse location data.</li>
      <li>Usage analytics, crash analytics, or gameplay event data.</li>
      <li>Payment or billing information.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Because we do not collect data, we do not sell or share personal information with any third parties.</p>

    <h2>Platform- and Device-Level Data</h2>
    <p>The App itself does not transmit data to us. However, platform providers (such as app stores), web browsers, operating systems, and device manufacturers may process diagnostic, crash, or usage information under their own privacy policies. We do not control or receive that data.</p>

    <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>The App is designed not to collect personal information from any user, including children. If you believe a child has provided personal information to us, please contact us using the email below so we can investigate; however, the App includes no mechanisms to submit such information.</p>

    <h2>Your Privacy Rights</h2>
    <p>Some jurisdictions (e.g., the EU/UK GDPR or the California Consumer Privacy Act) provide rights concerning personal data. Because the App does not process personal data, these rights generally do not apply to the App’s current operation. If you have questions, you may still contact us and we will respond appropriately.</p>

    <h2>Data Security, Retention, and Transfers</h2>
    <p>The App does not collect or retain personal data. Consequently, there is no personal data to secure, transfer, or delete in connection with your use of the App.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If future versions introduce features that involve data collection (for example, analytics or advertising), we will update this Privacy Policy, revise the “Last updated” date above, and, where required, obtain consent within the App before enabling those features.</p>

    <h2>Contact</h2>
    <p>If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at <a href="mailto:laurentianapps@gmail.com">laurentianapps@gmail.com</a>.</p>

    <footer>
      <p>This page describes the App’s current behavior regarding data collection and privacy across all platforms. We recommend reviewing it periodically for updates.</p>
